This is a receipt scanner for receipts from the German-speaking world.

The programme is set up as a pure Java project with Maven as project management tool. 
The libraries used include: 
Tess4j - OCR scanner,
Fastexcel - For handling Excel files,
JavaFX - GUI

It is certainly one of many and there are certainly far better applications of this kind to be found online.
But first and foremost this project should reflect my skills. Current status: WIP

#tess4j is based on tesseract. 
to achieve an optimal result of the ocr scanner, the programme requires black and white scans of the receipts with 300dpi
